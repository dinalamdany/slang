##Tests
The tests are broken up and named with prefixes signifying which part of the LRM they are testing. The unit tests not only looks for acceptable code, but also checks for code that should not be accepted.

For example, program1.sl, program2.sl, program3.sl ... etc all test statements made under the "Program" description in the LRM.

Due to the nature of attempting to test every line of the LRM, there will be overlapping tests for the same errors.
